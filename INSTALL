Dependencies
============

Cairo
  If you plan on doing GUI development, you will need to install Cairo from
  http://cairographics.org/. On Windows, we precompiled it for you as a DLL
  so it is already installed. On other systems, you should install it the
  usual way with your package manager and Jazz will use pkg-config to find
  the various paths. If you are on Mac OS X, the simplest way to install Cairo
  is through macports. See the next section for details on installing macports
  if you don't already have it. With macports installed, installing cairo is
  easy. Simply execute the following command from any terminal:
  "sudo port install cairo". Note that on systems that support both binary
  and development packages you should install the cairo-dev development
  package.

Macports
  You install macports from http://www.macports.org/. Note that a standard
  Mac OS X Package (.pkg) Installer is available. After the installation, you
  will need to edit your ~/.bash_profile file. Add /opt/local/bin to your PATH
  variable if it is not already there, and add the following line anywhere:
  "export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/local/lib/pkgconfig".

X11 on the Mac
  Due to a bug in Apple's installed version of X11, if you plan on using X11
  on the Mac, you will need to install the latest X11 from Apple's official
  site for X11: http://xquartz.macosforge.org/. Note that depending on your
  settings, X11 may need to be manually started before launching Jedi.

MinGW
  On Windows, the only backend fully tested to work with JazzScheme is MinGW.
  Note that some people have reported problems when building JazzScheme with
  old versions of MinGW. You can get the latest version of MinGW from
  http://www.mingw.org/. Another reported problem was from someone having both
  Cygwin and MinGW installed, where MinGW would wrongly call Cygwin's gcc.
  Uninstalling Cygwin fixed the problem.

  Also, as both MinGW and Git come with their own shell, the simplest way to
  have a shell supporting both, which is required to build Jazz, is to select
  the "Run Git and included Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt" when
  installing Git and then using the MinGW shell.


Sources
=======

Jedi uses Git http://git.or.cz/ to store and access all development files.

Repository
  The Jedi repository is currently hosted at
    git://github.com/jazzscheme/jedi.git

Help
  Some usefull Git links :
  - http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/
  - http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html
  - http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html

Troubleshooting
  If you get an error like "fatal: unable to connect a socket (Connection timed out)"
  it may be that you are behind a firewall that blocks outbound connections on Git's
  port 9418.


Scenarios
---------

User
  ;; Clone the Jedi repository (only once).
  ;; This will create a 'jedi' directory containing all development files.
  $ git clone git://github.com/jazzscheme/jedi.git
  $ cd jedi

  ;; Pull from time to time to get the latest revision.
  $ git pull

Contributor
  ;; Clone the Jedi repository (only once).
  ;; This will create a 'jedi' directory containing all development files.
  $ git clone git://github.com/jazzscheme/jedi.git
  $ cd jedi

  ;; Add email and name information that will appear in patches you submit.
  $ git config user.email "you@email.com"
  $ git config user.name "Your Name"

  ;; Create a public branch that will be used to rebase your changes.
  $ git branch public

  ;; Commit changes you made and want to contribute.
  ;; Note that the -a option is necessary if you added any new files.
  $ git commit -a -m "Some message describing your changes"

  ;; Pull from time to time to get the latest revision and rebase your changes.
  ;; Rebasing your changes before sending your changes as patches will greatly
  ;; minimize risks of conflicts when the Jedi maintainers apply your patches to
  ;; the central repository.
  $ git checkout public
  $ git pull origin master
  $ git checkout master
  $ git rebase public
  ;; Optional step: fix any rebase conflicts.
  ;; See http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html for details.
  ;; Edit and resolve conflicts in all the conflicting files.
  $ git add <list of resolved files>
  $ git rebase --continue

  ;; Send contributions as a series of patch files.
  $ git format-patch origin
  <email generated patch files to gcartier@jazzscheme.org>

Maintainer
  ;; Publish some changes.
  $ git push pub master

  ;; Merge contributions.
  $ git am -3 *.patch
  ;; Optional step: fix any conflict.
  $ git am --resolved


Building
========

To build Jedi, simply invoke the ./jam (Jazz Manager) script from the Jedi source directory.
Jam will take care of updating any Git submodule dependencies and of building all the source
files that have changed since the last build.

The build system follows the usual configure / make methodology but as the underlying
Scheme system already represents a platform independant abstraction, there is no need to
use the low-level GNU tools. The build system is fully implemented in Scheme, accessed using
the ./jam script.

Do not worry about the many warnings generated when building the platform modules. These are
due to limitations in the current implementation of Gambit's foreign-function interface and
can be safely ignored.

A full build of Jazz will take about 10mn on a MacBook Pro and require about 2G of memory
to build without disk swapping.


Examples
--------

Building Jedi
  $ cd jedi
  $ ./jam
  JazzScheme Build System v2.6

  ;; Create the default configuration
  % configure
  <default>
    system: gambit
    platform: windows
    safety: release
    ...

  ;; Build the default target: 'jedi'
  % make
  ...

  ;; Quit the build system
  % quit

  ;; Launch Jedi
  $ bin/jedi

Building many targets at a time
  $ cd jedi
  $ ./jam
  JazzScheme Build System v2.6

  ;; This will build :
  ;; - the jazz target in the default configuration
  ;; - the platform target in the debug configuration
  ;; - the default target in the release configuration
  % make jazz platform@debug @release
  ...


Scripting
---------

Launching the build system using jam with no options starts it in interactive mode
which is unsuitable for batch scripting.

For scripting, the build system can be invoked directly from the command line :

$ ./jam [options]


configure
---------

Register a new configuration.

To support multiple configurations, configurations can optionaly be named.

Configurations are loaded / saved from a .configurations file located in the
.jazz directory of the user's home. Using configure is basically an easy way
to edit the .configurations file.

configure
  [name: name]
  [system: system]
  [platform: platform]
  [windowing: windowing]
  [safety: safety]
  [optimize?: optimize?]
  [debug-environments?: debug-environments?]
  [debug-location?: debug-location?]
  [debug-source?: debug-source?]
  [kernel-interpret?: kernel-interpret?]
  [destination: destination]

name
  The optional name. Must be alphanumeric.

system
  The underlying Scheme system (automatically determined)
  - gambit (the only fully supported scheme system at the moment)
  - chicken
  - ...

platform
  The platform (will try and guess based on system type)
  - mac
  - windows
  - unix

windowing
  The windowing system (will try and guess based on system type)
  - carbon (development started)
  - x11 (almost there)
  - #f (use default platform windowing)

safety
  The runtime safety level
  - core
      Core debug mode for debugging JazzScheme itself. Adds tests to make the
      kernel and core safe.
  - debug
      Standard debug mode with tests to make user code safe. This is the
      recommanded safety for development.
  - release (the default)
      Release mode for stable user code with no safety tests. If you plan on
      using Jedi, you may want to build using this safety level as it will run
      alot faster.

optimize?
  This option adds optimization declares to the source code. Note that this
  will make debugging somewhat harder as the generated code will have gone
  through some transformations. At the moment it adds: proper-tail-calls,
  constant-fold and lambda-lift.
  - #f
  - #t (the default)

debug-source?
  Include source in compiled code by compiling with Gambit's 'debug-source'
  option.

  Note that this option is not needed anymore for using the statprof statistical
  profiler with compiled files since the new 'debug-location' option was added
  to Gambit.

  Do not use this option unless you have a very specific need for it as it will
  result in much larger object files and due to a flaw in gcc also result in longer
  compile times.
  - #f (the default)
  - #t

kernel-interpret?
  An option for Jazz developers to enable loading the kernel fully interpreted.
  - #f (the default)
  - #t

destination
  The optional build destination (defaults to "bin").

  The destination specifies the directory where files will be built relative to the
  current directory.

  Note that being able to specify an explicit build destination enables building
  multiple configurations under the current directory.


make
----

Build target for a configuration.

make [target@configuration:image] ...

target
  The optional target to build which defaults to 'jedi'.

  - kernel       : the unit system
  - core         : the module system
  - scheme       : the scheme dialect
  - jazz         : the jazz dialect
  - platform     : the platform packages
  - jedi         : the jedi ide
  - all          : all the pre-installed packages
  - clean        : remove all build files
  - cleankernel  : remove all kernel files
  - cleanobject  : remove all object files
  - cleanlibrary : remove all library files
  - <product>    : user <product>

configuration
  The optional configuration which defaults to the default configuration.

image
  The optional image which defaults to 'exe'.

  - exe | executable : build an executable
  - lib | library    : build a gambit .o1 loadable library


make clean
----------

Clean a configuration by removing all build files.

make [clean@configuration] ...

configuration
  The optional configuration which defaults to the default configuration.


make cleankernel
----------------

Clean a configuration's kernel by removing all kernel files.

make [cleankernel@configuration] ...

configuration
  The optional configuration which defaults to the default configuration.


make cleanobject
----------------

Clean a configuration's object files.

make [cleanobject@configuration] ...

configuration
  The optional configuration which defaults to the default configuration.


make cleanlibrary
-----------------

Clean a configuration's library files.

make [cleanlibrary@configuration] ...

configuration
  The optional configuration which defaults to the default configuration.


make install
------------

There is no equivalent of make install due to the complexity of supporting
multiple systems and user preferences. Since this step is also very simple to
do manually, installing the built configuration is left to the user.

Depending on your system you will usually
  - Copy the built files to standard system locations or
  - Modify your environment variables to point to the location of the Jazz
    executable

Note that at this time, modifying your environment variables is the preferred
approach as some units like Jedi are still dependent on source files.


list
----

List configurations.

list


delete
------

Delete a configuration.

delete [configuration]

configuration
  The optional configuration which defaults to the default configuration.


quit
----

Quit the build system.

quit


Troubleshooting
---------------

The following instructions presuppose basic knowledge of Gambit's REPL
(Read Eval Print Loop) that is used for debugging Gambit code. See Gambit's
manual for details.

If you get an error while building, and the message is not enough to understand
the problem, you can follow the following instructions to get a full-fledged
Gambit REPL to explore the problem further.

First, you have to determine if the error is occuring while building the kernel
or while building a product. Each build step displays a message of the following
format: 'make <target>'. Any <target> other than 'kernel' means that it is a
product that is being built.

- If the problem is in building the kernel, launch the build system in debug
  mode with: './jam debug'. This will disable the build system's own REPL and
  get you a Gambit REPL. To build configuration <configuration-name>:<image>,
  execute: (jazz:make 'kernel@<configuration-name>:<image>).

- Else, find the built 'kernel.exe' kernel located inside the build directory
  and launch it like this: kernel -make target -debug.
