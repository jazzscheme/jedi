Building
========

Please see INSTALL for details and examples on building Jedi.


Launching
=========

Launch
  Once you have built Jedi you can launch it using the jedi executable.

Debugging
  If you get an error before the IDE is fully functional, you will end up in
  the Gambit debugger. This is not as painful as would appear as JazzScheme
  code is very close to the generated Scheme code so that inspecting a Jazz
  stack inside the Gambit debugger is very easy. Having access to a lower level
  debugger is even a very nice feature as it is virtually impossible to crash
  the IDE even when modifying a critical piece of code (like inserting a bug in
  the view system for instance) as the Gambit debugger is completely self
  contained.

  If you get an error that brings you to the Gambit debugger, the console will
  automatically open. You can then use all of Gambit's debugging command to
  debug your code and when you are done, simply execute the (resume) command.
  This will resume the IDE's message loop making it again functional.
